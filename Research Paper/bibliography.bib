	title = {Global Aging in a Comparative Context},
	journal = {The Gerontologist},
	abstract = {The structure is clear. Chapter 1 considers the aging world and cultural impacts on aging and the place of older adults, followed by Chapter 2’s detailed discussion of comparative global aging. Chapter 3 provides a careful presentation of the demographic drivers of global aging, while Chapter 4 is devoted to the role of the social and physical environments on population aging. These chapters provide excellent context, valuable both for experts and those new to the field. Subsequent chapters provide extensive accounts of aging and health, considering patterns of health and health-seeking behavior (Chapter 5), health systems and models of health care delivery (Chapter 6), and social policies and programs that provide long-term services and support for older adults (Chapter 7). Key contemporary issues explored in Chapters 8 to 11 are work, employment, and retirement in its various manifestations; formal and informal support; and the challenges for families and societies to provide care for frail and chronically ill older adults. Chapter 12 explores the perspectives of key global religions on aging and the behavior of older persons. The final chapter (Chapter 13) assesses aging and global leadership and how effectively global powers respond to the socioeconomic and demographic challenges of older people and their families. Crucially, the volume uniquely offers a wide range of country-based case studies to provide outstanding depth to the various chapters.},

Cited as one of gerontology’s “greatest hits,” the work has spawned multiple variations on the theme, including “productive aging,” “positive aging,” “healthy aging,” and others (Pruchno, 2014).The phrase “active aging” surfaced in Europe during the 1990s as a framework for developing policies to promote the labor force participation of older adults (Foster &amp; Walker, 2014). In 2002, the World Health Organization (WHO) published its Active Aging Policy Framework for the second United Nations World Assembly on Aging in Madrid. This model introduced three pillars of active aging: health, participation, and security. It identified six types of “determinants” of active aging that might be influenced by public policy (health, behavioral, personal, social, economic, and physical), as well as two “cross-cutting determinants” (gender and culture).},

	pages = {1451-1462},
	abstract = {Objectives To describe new WHO 2020 guidelines on physical activity and sedentary behaviour.Methods The guidelines were developed in accordance with WHO protocols. An expert Guideline Development Group reviewed evidence to assess associations between physical activity and sedentary behaviour for an agreed set of health outcomes and population groups. The assessment used and systematically updated recent relevant systematic reviews; new primary reviews addressed additional health outcomes or subpopulations.Results The new guidelines address children, adolescents, adults, older adults and include new specific recommendations for pregnant and postpartum women and people living with chronic conditions or disability. All adults should undertake 150–300 min of moderate-intensity, or 75–150 min of vigorous-intensity physical activity, or some equivalent combination of moderate-intensity and vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, per week. Among children and adolescents, an average of 60 min/day of moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic physical activity across the week provides health benefits. The guidelines recommend regular muscle-strengthening activity for all age groups. Additionally, reducing sedentary behaviours is recommended across all age groups and abilities, although evidence was insufficient to quantify a sedentary behaviour threshold.Conclusion These 2020 WHO guidelines update previous WHO recommendations released in 2010. They reaffirm messages that some physical activity is better than none, that more physical activity is better for optimal health outcomes and provide a new recommendation on reducing sedentary behaviours. These guidelines highlight the importance of regularly undertaking both aerobic and muscle strengthening activities and for the first time, there are specific recommendations for specific populations including for pregnant and postpartum women and people living with chronic conditions or disability. These guidelines should be used to inform national health policies aligned with the WHO Global Action Plan on Physical Activity 2018–2030 and to strengthen surveillance systems that track progress towards national and global targets.},

While offering patients a better quality of life as they may spend less time in hospitals, wearables can also play a key role in solving the current crises in the health sector. 1’195 articles were screened, and 41 papers in total were analyzed for the review. Most studies focused on product design, specifically user acceptance and user adaption. Some studies investigated how machine learning can improve the accuracy and reliability of wearables or focused on the quality of treatment and how wearables can improve a patient’s quality of life. However, one important aspect, how to handle big data issues like security and privacy for wearables is mostly neglected. Further research is required, dealing with the questions, how devices can become secure for patients and how the data of patients will not become accessible.},

	abstract = {With the growing number of silver hair people, they cannot ignore the care system, fall is one of the important causes of death from accident injury. If the fall is not detected in time, the consequences may be very serious, even. The psychological haze caused by the injured leads to a reduction in activity. The care system includes a smartwatch to monitor physiological values and detect falls, a Beacon device for indoor positioning, and outdoor air quality sensors. And set up a cloud server in Amazon to act as a system hub, designed an APP on the Android platform to control location, physiology, medication status, and give timely reminders. In the smartwatch fall detection section, this study proposes an adaptive threshold algorithm based on fuzzy theory to determine the fall. When a fall occurs, Beacon immediately locates the caregiver position and via Wi-Fi sends packets containing the location of the fall and the identity of the caregiver to the server, and sends notifications to the caregiver mobile app through the server. In the experiment, the acceleration data of six male and six female subjects were collected during daily activities and falls, and then analyzed the difference in the acceleration value of different height and weight during fall. 93.75% Sensitivity and 97.5% Specificity. This system enables existing care providers to get more real-time information and feedback, thereby improving overall service quality and efficiency, reducing human costs and resource consumption.},

In the past decade, an extensive amount of research has been carried out to develop fall detection systems based on a range of different detection approaches, i.e, wearable and non-wearable sensing and detection technologies. In this paper, we consider an emerging non-wearable fall detection approach based on WiFi Channel State Information (CSI). Previous CSI based fall detection solutions have considered only time domain approaches. Here, we take an altogether different direction, time-frequency analysis as used in radar fall detection. We use the conventional Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to extract time-frequency features and a sequential forward selection algorithm to single out features that are resilient to environment changes while maintaining a higher fall detection rate. When our system is pre-trained, it has a 93% accuracy and compared to RTFall and CARM, this is a 12% and 15% improvement respectively. When the environment changes, our system still has an average accuracy close to 80% which is more than a 20% to 30% and 5% to 15% improvement respectively.},

	abstract = {Fall detection and notification systems play an important role in our daily life, since human fall is a major health concern for many communities in today's aging population. There are different approaches used in developing human fall detection systems for elderly and people with special needs such as disable. The three basic approaches include some sort of wearable, non-wearable ambient sensor and vision based systems. This paper proposes a human fall detection system based on the velocity and position of the subject, extracted from Microsoft Kinect Sensor. Initially the subject and floor plane are extracted and tracked frame by frame. The tracked joints of the subject are then used to measure the velocity with respect to the previous location. Fall detection is confirmed using the position of the subject to see if all the joints are on the floor after an abnormal velocity. From the experimental results obtained, our system was able to achieve an average accuracy of 93.94% with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 91.3%.}

The extracted features are discriminative enough to describe human postures and not too computationally complex to allow a fast processing. The fall detection is addressed as a statistical anomaly detection problem. The proposed approach combines modeling using principal component analysis modeling with the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) monitoring chart. The EWMA scheme is applied on the ignored principal components to detect the presence of falls. Using two different fall detection datasets, URFD and FDD, we have demonstrated the greater sensitivity and effectiveness of the developed method over the conventional PCA-based methods.}

	volume = {130},
	pages = {103946},
	abstract = {Background wearable sensors are often used to acquire data for gait analysis as a strategy to study fall events, due to greater availability of acquisition platforms, and advances in computational intelligence. However, there are no review papers addressing the three most common types of applications related to fall using sensors, namely: fall detection, fallers classification and fall risk screening. Objective To identify the state of art of fall-related events detection in older person using wearable sensors, as well as the main characteristics of the studies in the literature, pointing gaps for future studies. Methods A systematic review design was used to search peer-reviewed literature on fall detection and risk in elderly through inertial sensors, published in English, Portuguese, Spanish or French between August 2002 and June 2019. The following questions are investigated: the type of sensors and their sampling rate, the type of signal and data processing employed, the scales and tests used in the study and the type of application. Results We identified 608 studies, from which 29 were included. The accelerometer, with sampling rate 50 or 100 Hz, allocated in the waist or lumbar was the most used sensor setting. Methods comparing features or variables extracted from the accelerometry signal are the most common, and fall risk screening the most observed application. Conclusion This review identifies the main elements to be addressed in studies on the detection of events related to falls in the elderly and may help in future studies on the subject. However, some aspects are still no reach consensus in the literature such as the size of the sample to be studied, the population under study and how to acquire data for each application.},

An electronic search was conducted on Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore databases, combining relevant keywords. After the studies’ selection, 27 studies were included. The results show the interest in using context-aware features to develop smart cities’ applications targeting public health, tourism experience, urban mobility, active citizenship, shopping experience, management of urban infrastructures, public alerts, recommenders, and smart environments. Moreover, the applications reported by the included studies do not allow the execution of actions without the explicit consent of the users, and they integrate personal sensors, sensors deployed in the city and crowdsourcing mechanisms to acquire primary context attributes (i.e., location, activity, and environment) and secondary context attributes (i.e., speed, physical activity, points of interest, stress, and tourists’ emotions). In addition, the included studies present scarce details about context reasoning, data privacy, integrity, and confidentiality, data aggregation and accuracy, and data interoperability. Finally, the results also indicate low maturity level of the developed applications, which is evidenced by the lack of user-centred evaluations, as well as by the difficulty in integrating important technologies being developed for smart cities.},
